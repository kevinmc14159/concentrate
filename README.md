# Concentrate
*Concentrate* is a Python script that blocks distracting websites during work hours.

## How to Use
To begin setup, customize *hosts_path* to the location of your hosts file. Next, update the block list with websites to block. Finally, update *start_time* and *stop_time* to change the time frame when accessing the sites is restricted.

To run, execute the file from the command line or via Task Scheduler.

## What I Learned
* Small, simple programs can have big impact under certain contexts.
* *.pyw* files are run without an associated console.
* Goals can be deconstructed into concepts such as data types, decision making, and looping.
